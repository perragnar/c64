# C64 - A retro theme for Visual Studio Code

This is my third vscode theme and this time it's not a very useful one. But it's pretty, I promise! :)

## Recommended settings

The theme itself isn't enough to get that retro feeling. Head over to [style64.org](http://style64.org/c64-truetype) and install the C64 font.  
You can also try some settings to tweak the editor even more:

```
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "C64 Pro Mono",
    "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
    "editor.cursorStyle": "block",
    "editor.cursorBlinking": "blink",
    "editor.lineNumbers": "off",
    "editor.renderIndentGuides": false
}
```

Try Zen Mode also for a full screen experience. <kbd>âŒ˜K</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> on a Mac or <kbd>ctrl+K</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> on Windows and Linux machines.

Enjoy!
