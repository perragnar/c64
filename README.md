# C64 - A retro theme for Visual Studio Code

This is my third vscode theme and this time it's not a very useful one. But it's pretty, I promise! :)
There are probably a few bugs btw.

## Recommended settings

The theme itself isn't enough to get that retro feeling. Head over to [style64.org](http://style64.org/c64-truetype) and install the C64 font.  
You can also try some settings to tweak the editor even more:

```
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "C64 Pro Mono",
    "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
    "editor.cursorStyle": "block",
    "editor.cursorBlinking": "blink",
    "editor.lineNumbers": "off",
    "editor.renderIndentGuides": false
}
```

Try Zen Mode also for a full screen experience. <kbd>âŒ˜K</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> on a Mac or <kbd>ctrl+K</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> on Windows and Linux machines.

## More SWAG?

If you have a Mac and want to go even further with the C64 feel, head over to Github and download [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term).
Go to settings and import this config:

```json
{
  "ambientLight": 0.16,
  "backgroundColor": "#000000",
  "bloom": 0.4,
  "brightness": 0.5,
  "burnIn": 0.4,
  "chromaColor": 0,
  "contrast": 0.85,
  "flickering": 0.1,
  "fontColor": "#00ff5b",
  "fontName": "COMMODORE_PET",
  "fontWidth": 1,
  "frameName": "SIMPLE_WHITE_FRAME",
  "glowingLine": 0.2,
  "horizontalSync": 0.14,
  "jitter": 0.11,
  "rasterization": 1,
  "rbgShift": 0,
  "saturationColor": 0,
  "screenCurvature": 0.1,
  "staticNoise": 0.05,
  "windowOpacity": 1,
  "name": "C64"
}
```

Enjoy!
